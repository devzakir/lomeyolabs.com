# My thoughts around LomeyoLabs new Website

Hey, I am trying to build a website for my companies. we craft digital products such as software solutions for small businesses, we craft ready-made scripts and templates to launch their online business sooner and faster.

We have some products and their detail pages, Plus we have a dedicated landing pages for best-selling products. We might sell product related services as well, for example installation service and there will be users, who will create some tickets with us as well. well, maybe. so porbably we need login, registration for customers as well.

We would like to use Paddle or Stripe but not quite sure.

The thing, we are busy crafting digital products and customer support. We don't want to invest time for than required to manage this website, we just want to get it done. Make it beautiful, responsive and best websites for our customers and future customers.

We have many choices such as cloud hosted cms like webflow or framer, although we don't know how to use them, how to develop websites within them and they cost around $30 to $40 per month.

we have options to use TailwinCSS, react to build the websites fasters, we have a premium ui kit which we purchased, we are develoeprs, we are expert tailwind css and react but what about backend? we have many choices for headless cms which is free, and building the websites using supabase database they have a free tier as well.

the goal is, we want to build beautiful websites, with less minimum time and cost, and 0 maintaince if possible.
