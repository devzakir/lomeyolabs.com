We need to make sure that the site is indexed by search engines. we are migrating from templatecookie.com to lomeyolabs.com.

We want that our site is indexed by all major search engines, AI search engines, and social media platforms. Every product page should have a canonical link to the product page on the templatecookie.com site and optimized seo for each product.

Basically all the products is available on the templatecookie.com site and now we are migrating to lomeyolabs.com. Now we want to all search engines to index the new site and redirect the old site to the new site.
